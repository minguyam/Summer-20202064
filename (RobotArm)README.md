Hi~
This code allows you to control the robot arm.

To control the base arm do the following:
q = go counterclockwise
a = go clockwise

To control the second arm. The horizontal arm do the following:
w = go counterclockwise
s = go clockwise

To control the third arm. The vertical arm that is connected to the gripper:
e = go counterclockwise
d = go clockwise

To control the gripper:
Press the spacebar to make the gripper width shorter.
Kind of like gripping something.
When you press the space bar, the color changes to pink.
When you press the spacebar again, it goes back to the original color

Have Fun~~~
